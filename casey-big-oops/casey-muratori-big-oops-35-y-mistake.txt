Casey Muratori – The Big OOPs: Anatomy of a Thirty-five-year Mistake – BSC 2025

- Looking Glass (Influential Game company)
  Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA)
  - Ultimate underworld (game) started the 3D revolution & PC gaming
  - Thief the Dark Project (game/franchise) (1998), first stealth/action game
  - how they modeled entities:
    - before: (ultimate underworld 1 & 2)
      (2min) fat structs, everything in one struct, limited memory, everyone did
      that because that what worked!
    - (2m50) then at that time, people started to have a hierarchy of things,
      class + subclasses
    -> Looking Glass decided not to go that route, instead (for Thief the dark project)
      (3m20)"we want all of our systems to be the primary thing that we're going to think about"
      "we want to put things in terms of their system, not in terms of the entity"
      they would use an ID for each entity, no data associated with it at all,
      the way we form the entity's data is by using that ID to look up into a 
      system and say "what's the physics/combat/fuel/... for this thing"
      -> They ship the first instance of an actually commercially released
      Entity Component System (ECS)
      => (5m) Encapsulation boundaries are the red lines (between systems)
      => Encapsulation boundaries are what we really care about when we're doing
      architecture, we care about: where we make it difficult to access things
      and where we make it easy
      - they decided to draw the encap. bound. around the systems,
      this is very different because the traditional OOP model draws the EB around
      the objects
      (like an object/class has all the data & method to define its behavior)
      (while the other model, systems are put together, and an object is represented
      by an ID, which can pick & choose in these systems)
      
🗒️==> [recap] The influential gaming company "Looking Glass" known for "Ultima Underworld"
considered as one of the first 3D game, ship one if not the first instance of
an Entity Component System when they released the game "Thief the Dark Project". (98)
Instead of going with the OOP methods, that creates hierarchies of class, and
create encapsulation boundaries between objects. They created encapsulation
boundaries between systems!
-----------------

- (6min) OOP has gotten into this mindset of: "A compile-time hierarchy that matches the domain model" - Marc "Mahk" LeBlanc
  - you're thinking about the domain model and you're bringing it into the software world
  - why are we pushing this?
    we can still do OOP style stuff, by changing our paradigm of what we're
    thinking about in terms of our domain model.
    Don't make the domain model be in the code, make that smth the user experiences,
    but the code is done in a way that makes sense for the code
  - Casey's own addition:
    OOP = "compile-time hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model"
    - encapsulation is what determines wheter the code is easy or hard to write,
      are those boundaries in the right place

- (7min) The internet
we went on the internet, there are "social media", where you can yap, people
talked about using OOP, it was pushed, and got adopted everywhere, some people
were arguing that it was bad
No way all these smart guys are wrong, surely it's based on academic studies or
smth, someone must have known right?
can you really say that this is bad => TL;DR: YES !!!
- the long answer is the rest of this talk:
The Big OOPs: anatomy of a 35 year mistake, to figure out where we went wrong,
what happened.
- not necessarly talking about OOP as a whole, he's talking about very specific
things in it
====> !!! he's not saying that OOP was mistake but that
"compile-time hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model" was a
mistake <====

----------------------
🗒️ before this: intro
🗒️ Casey isn't saying that "OOP as a whole was a mistake but that "compile-time
hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model" was a mistake.
This talk is to justify this claim!
🗒️ after this: the talk
----------------------

- we have a lot of historical evidence that show that people were pushing the
"you should look at the domain model and you should code that directly into
compile hierarchy". (11m48)
  - ex: (12:07) Bjarne Stroustrup "OOP is programming using inheritance" (1988) (13min)
- (13:13) alan kay (2003) this is true, but said too late
	  alan kay (1993) inheritance has turned out to be very difficult for novices to deal with
	  alan kay (1984) pretty much talking about representing in the hierarchy what your domain model is
  (16m) Stroustrup (1994) criticize Smalltalk that encourages people to see
        inheritance as the sole or [...] primary way of organizing programs...
	  [info: alan kay one of the OOP father, created "Flex" prog lang, considered precursor of smalltalk]
	  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
🗒️ he doesn't want to hear anybody say that nobody pushed this idea, because
there are too many historical evidence!
----------------------

(16m30) The origin story of the "entity" hierarchy
- we'll start with C++, most important language that promulgated this inheritance
hierarchy concept out to the world
- Cambridge university, cambridge, england (~1978)
- Stroustrup was working on distributed systems
"i was trying to develop a high-lvl architectural support for modularity, for
having hardware-protected entities talk to each-other",
he had to write a simulation,
he learned Simula (by talking with one of its creator),
he wrote a simulator in Simula, it was a pleasure to write that simulator,
=> he was working with lot of small programs talking to each other.
the class concept (of simula) allowed to map his application concepts into the
language constructs in a direct way
-> he was working on a model of things that are encapsulated.
(the computers can't talk to each other, the different processes in the computer
can't talk to each other) -> it's an exact fit for what a class does
- type system & ability to catch type errors
- he didn't like Pascal, type system worse than useless
- (22m44) "the implementation of simula, however, did not scale in the same way
and as a result the whole project came close to disaster."
  -> he tried to run the simula program but he had all sorts of problems,
     it started even before he tried to run it
  -> build times were through the roof
  "link times for separately compiled classes were abysmal"
  -> "the run-time performance was such that there was no hope of using the 
      simulator to obtain real data."
      -> 80% of the time was spent in the garbage collector
  => he rewrote the simulator in BCPL

- he goes to Bell Labs, he's doing the same sorts of distributed systems analysis
for Unix (uses C), he would like to do it with smth like Simula, can we have
C with classes?
- C with Classes was still thought of primarily as an extension to C for
expressing modularity and concurrency
- he's looking at things like virtual mem & protection between processes... and
that's what he wants for programming
- "the OS notion of read/write protection grew into C++'s notion of const"
- In addtion to the modeling part, they're using inheritance for the purpose of
code reuse. Even if it really doesn't have much to do with anything.
- everything else after that isn't relevant, are arguments that can't explain why
C++ exists...
- there's this idea of virtual function that comes later
- Bjarne said that classes & inheritance wasn't good for building collections
(vector, list, queue...), templates fix this problem

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
🗒️ Bjarne Stroustrup was working on embedded systems, he wrote a simulator using
Simula, he loved the experience, the classes to model his application + type
systems + catching type errors; but it linking was really slow, and runtime was
so slow, that there was no hope to obtain real data. 80% of the time was spent
in the garbage collector even tho there wasn't any garbage!
That's why he created C with Classes at Bell Labs (original C++ name)
(he's not a PL guy, he's a lowlevel/hardware guy)

in his talk, casey is trying to convince us that Stroustrup was really thinking
about encapsulation by thinking about low level/hardware/OS stuff, virtual mem,
process protection...
He's trying to trace back where these ideas come from: for C++ it's OS/embedded
system stuff! Not because OOP works well for big teams or some shit!

=> he wants us to understand all of the things that were being thought about
with inheritance at the time when it was actually being put into more mainstream
languages, which are:
- domain modeling part, direct mapping from domain to classes
- inheritance as a way for code reuse
he's not talking about:
- large teams
- about architecture
----------------------

- let's go back to Simula
  Norwegian Computing Center, Oslo, Norway (1962)
  Ole-Johan Dahl & Kristen Nygaard
- operations research: how to optimize process/operations (how to maximize
mcdonald's employee productivity, idk (I made it up))
- simula is like a scripting language for system simulation
- simula 1 had shortcoming
|-> simula 67
 - thinking about code reuse
   (36:23) (partial similarity fairly often -> programming effort could be saved...)
 - they were thinking in terms of a toll booth on a bridge, with a queue of cars
 which were either trucks or buses (<= this is what they were trying to solve
 when they came up with classes) (ex: 37m29)
   link class car (...)
   car class truck ...
   car class bus ...
- we see both things they're about to do &  that Bjarne also was going to do
  -> using inheritance for code reuse
  -> following the domain model with our classes

- virtual function came a bit latter
  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
🗒️ TODO

----------------------
- what we're seeing, is a sort of an approach to templates that wasn't very good,
that's not their fault, nobody knew anything at that time!
maybe they may never have invented this class concept at all, if they had templates
- we know that they did those things, but where did they get the ideas
- (42:27) the idea of subclass comes from C. A. R. Hoare (the guy who invented
quicksort)
-> Hoare says "In the real world, it is often useful to consider a class of
object as being split into [...] subclasses"
  => model the domain/world
  -> syntax example at 44m32
-> Hoare also talked about "tagged union" pretty much: (yeah, actually feels like
stuff I do in zig) "discriminated union"
"the programmer will usually [...] wish to determine to which of the possible
subclasses, the record [...] actually belongs. [...] record class discriminator"
(1966)
  - sort of a switch statement (46m30)
  - this adds type safety (he says this in the paper)
    "variable 'e' may safely be used [..] for private fields of the relevant subclass.

- alright so if the original paper had "discriminated union", where did it go?
Nygaard actually put it in (simula), it was called INSPECT (47:54)
  - (1994) Bjarne, "INSPECT .. was .. not introduced into C++. the reason for
  that is to encourage modularity through the use of virtual functions."
  He thought it was bad, because it broke modularity, because someone (inspect)
  from the outside can  tell what class you are.
  => Casey "we lost out on one of the most important feature I would use in C++
            every day, because it was removed"

==> not a single part of it, no hint at all that any of this is really about
compile time hierarchy stuff or about large team or about any of the things
we talk about today!
It was literally like: "I might have a record that wants to have a type field,
and it would be cool if I could switch on the type field and do different things
based on it (the type)".
-> we had this idea back in 1966
we could have had it from day 1, but we don't have it (maybe we have some bad
discriminated unions) if someone had just believed that this was good!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
🗒️ TODO
----------------------
(50min) BREAK, inermission

let's dig deeper
- where did Hoare get the idea? what was he working on?
  - this was really hard to find, didn't find much, but he found:
    there was this committee that was supposed to update Algol
  - on this committee there was Douglas T. Ross (picture at 55m38)
	- (51min) Ross sat on the Algol68 committee with C.A.R. Hoare, where his previous work
	on a record-like data structure (called a plex) influenced Hoare's own ideas on
	abstract data types... 
  - Ross influenced Hoare
- Alan Kay (inventor of smalltalk) got his ideas from Sketchpad & Simula (54m)
  - Sketchpad was a drawing program (see "part2" below)

- 1952, MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory (cambridge, Mass.)
  Douglas T. Ross worked there
  US department of defense research stuff
  - developed both hardware & software of computer graphics, developed AED system
  (Algol Extended for Design), it was the first language with types and complex
  data structures and that sort of thing!
  - they were trying to build a system where someone from like the Air Force,
  could describe a part that they were going to try to manufacture, and the
  computer would just make it (almost like 3D printing)
  (they had stuff working)
  -> this was early, the beginning of computer... 1950s
- COBOL was the first thing you'd see referenced as having things like 
record-like structs (1960)
we take struct for granteed, but that didn't exist, nobody thought about that,
they have sort of an idea of data records, some fields that comprise a record.
Nobody is thinking about the program having records that it's using purely for
computation.
- what people are actually thinking about is LISP (LISt Processor), published in
1960 (John McCarthy)
  - no concepts of record, just sequential bags of stuff
  - no concepts of structured data
- (1960) Douglas T. Ross:
  - (1h)LISP is kinda dumb: list and tree structure are too limited
    + consumes storage + computer time
  - he comes up with "a type of generic structure, called a plex"
    (which is pretty much a struct)
    - example at 1h3m,
      it has some: data + pointers + flags+function pointers
      - flags: what Ross is saying "when we're processing this stuff, we could run one
      subroutine and just based on what we stick in the plex, we could change how
      we're processing it. So we set or not flags depending on the path it should
      take.
      - TRA 562, TRA 467, are pretty much function pointers -> basically virtual functions
  - => team fat struct founded in 1960?
  - ex 2, (1h5m50) modeling points & line, winged edge data structure

the other part of the story
- (1960) MIT Lincoln Laboratory (Lexington, MA)
- sketchpad (where Alan Kay got his ideas)
- Ivan Sutherlan (pic @1h07m08) made sketchpad (largely by himself)
  first joined Lincoln Lab as an intern for the summer of 1960, then did PhD at MIT
- TX series computers, were pretty unusual because they had a display (screen)
  the guy who was architecting them (Wesley Clark) (made in this MIT Lab),
  integrated a light pen -> TX2 (TX0: first version, TX1: no such thing)
- this was funded by the air force to understand the behavior of large numbers
of transistors (that's it, not for computing or someting)
  => there was available compute time, that Ivan Sutherlan used (at 4am)
- Ivan Sutherlan convinces Wes Clark to be able to draw on the display
  (1h10) => sketchpad, can draw lines with the light pen, knows snapping (connecting line to point)
- Alan kay (87) "Ivan S.'s SketchPad - probably the most significant single thesis
ever done - remarkable program in many ways, even today".
- (1963) published thesis, completely new concepts no one's ever thought about
like the ability to erase a line with ease
or "to move drawing parts around .. without the need to erase them"
- Ross & Sutherland worked together
(1h12m59) "Ross, provided help and advice on n-component elements"
(Ross is working on CAD, ross told him about plex)
"in the drawings made by the Sketchpad system, there are large populations of
relatively few types of entities with very little variation in format between
entities of each type ... Each entity, therefore, is represented in the computer as
an n-component element..."
(1h14m28) diagram of n-component elements (63) Ivan Sutherland
 which looks a lot like Ross diagram
- in the original paper (60) Ross talks about Plex, and you find smth similar
in the 63 paper of Sutherland (1h15m37)
  - this is how he did things like "I want to go ahead and draw this shape,
  but I don't want to bother having actual different data types having completely
  specialized subroutines, so I'll just have a few entries to say how to
  display it, move it... => virtual functions
  - there are gaps, "all generic blocks still carry space ... because of historical reasons"
  SketchPad is on team Fat struct
  
- (1h18m) recap of history of where the ideas come from
  !!! literaly can recap most of what was said using this!

--info
CSG = Constructive Solid Geometry
est une branche de la modélisation des solides (ou modélisation 3D).
Cette technique de modélisation géométrique concerne la représentation d'un objet solide comme combinaison d'objets solides simples (exemple : cylindre, sphère, cône, tore, etc.) à l'aide d'opérateurs géométriques booléens (exemple : union, intersection, soustraction).
--end

- Ok, so why did he research all that instead of saying "who cares about these
things? I don't use those compile time hierarchies" and post something mean on
twitter???
- here's why: back in 97 (Seattle, WA) definitionSIX
  he's out of highschool, he doesn't know anything and he's asked by Chris Hecker
  to "make a level editor that does CSG on spheres"
  (he programmed at ton as a kid, but didn't know much)
  - he searched for papers about CSG spheres, (CSG = Constructive Solid Geometry)
    he finds "alpha shapes" (implicit surfaces)
    it's like spheres but when you move them together, they make this smooth join,
    so it could be better than CSG
    - the inside of these things (typically called metaballs)
      it was gonna be the negative space of the metaball
      he made a modeler for that he called "Negaman" for "negative metaball"
      (1h22m54) image of it
      - it was "selection-based UI"
      so user would select a bunch of things and then it would
      show a user interface that would be appropriate for that selection
      - he wanted the program to have a nice architecture
        (hard architecture problem)
        so he tried to do it "cleanly"
        but ended up with crap (1h25m14)
        "i've wrote some of the most ridiculous oop stuff you've ever seen"
        "it was awful, I'm not proud of it"
        - he has a class inheriting from some templated class
          + getters + setters + parallel data structure
          rich hickey functor
        - (1:28:40) he ended up with something that look like what lookingglass
        did, but bad
- 2024, he asked himself "how did Sketchpad do this anyway?
  sketchpad could do a lot of other stuff than just draw,
  the hardcore stuff only Sutherland knows how to do (1h30m)
  - (1h32) if we look at how he represented constraints, he's saying ther's
  going to be variables that are constrained.
  - "the ring structure was designed to permit ... rapid constraint satisfaction"
    "all refs made to a particular n-component element or block are collected
     together by a string of pointers which originates within that block"
     
     a hen is a sentinel of a linked list
     a chicken is a link in a linked list that points back to the sentinel
	...
  - 1h35m56 this is the runtime structure of sketchpad
    start with a Universe, it has a sentinel (or hen) that has a ring inside of
    which is "variables", "holders", "constraints" & "topos"
    ("topos" are lines, circles, pictures=copies of other drawings)
    => not a compile-time hierarchy
       but a runtime set of rings
    - this is kind of the opposite of encapsulation,
      at any time, any part of the system can go look at anything, almost a
      complete introspectoin system
    - if we draw it, it looks like this (1m37m36)
      => looks like ECS

- Ivan Sutherlan was this 🤏 close of ECS in 1963
  and nobody noticed, or realized how important that was
  - they didn't think about the fact that the power of this system is coming
  from the fact that you can look at these components of things and architect
  around that instead of architecting around the bag? which who cares?
  -> this is still OOP thinking but where are the encap. bound.?
  the virtual functions is the least interesting part of this architecture,
  yes it's cool, it's Doug T. Ross's idea about Plexes, it's where it come from
  & was a great idea & we should keep it, BUT it's not the cool part, it's the
  most trival part of it (of sketchpad)
  => they focused on the wrong thing -> that's the 35-year mistake, OOPs
  we have the answer, we could have been so far ahead if we just studied that
  and figured that out, because it's so much more powerful to think about systems
  that way, especially the hardest kinds of systems like editors!
  (MIT Lincoln Lab 63 <---> Looking  Glass (98))

- this quote from Alan Kay (93) breaks his heart
"another important system done .. was Alan Borning's Thinglab - the first serious
attempt to go beyond Ivan Sutherland's sketchpad. Alan devised a very nice approach
for dealing with constraints that did not require the solver to be omniscient
(or able to solve Fermat's last theorem)."
Alan Kay read the thesis & paid attention to the constraint solver part, but
Kay thought that "the solver being omniscient" was a bad thing
-> the "omniscient part" was the good part
why do they think it's bad?
their working background (molecular biology & distributed systems), they're both
thinking of little tiny cells that communicate back & forth which do not reach
across into each other's domain to do different things
 -> but this doens't seem to work when you're thinking about program that work
 inside one computer with the same core memory that's meant to work togehter,
 it's too limiting, it's not the right model

C didn't type check function calls at the time Stroustrup was making C w/ classes
C++ made positive contributions that actually do help you program

- the 35y mistake have consequence
 if you look for an OOP tuto now (2025), first thing you find is a compile time
 hierarchy that matches the domain model exactly like we don't want
- what we can do is get the message that "compi...." are not that good,
sometimes they work like distributed systems, but a lot of times, they're just
more work than they're worth



1h50 Q&A
- they didn't like the omniscient part, because they were focused on modularity
- he was programming as a kid without oop, then got exposed to oop, and it was
harder, then he met with some guys who wouldn't use OOP, and they were successful
that way
- important to make the distinction between OOP & "compile-time hierach..."
the guy who made ECS was still thinking in term of OOP
- he was focused on figuring out where these ideas came from

- discrimated union (tagged unions) as sort of fomring this mutually exclusive
branching structure, as opposed to the fat strcut model (one unified type),

2 types of situations I might find myself in:
1. where the domain model itself is telling me clearly that these things are
mutually exclusive (=> discriminated union), because I prefer to write code in
a "verb" oriented way, not an OO way, -> to catch error

2H04M19 deleted scene (how looking glass did it)
- inside ultima underworld, an enity was a fatty struct overlay (2:04:30)
  - so you had an entity, and if there were 2 sperate things like (HP or Fuel),
    they were generally mutually exclusive (meaning an entity can't have both of
    them), so we put them in the same place.
    (which mean you were accessing both stuff at the same time, easy to get wrong?)
  - picture of Mach (2h05m15), guy who did a lot of impl on the dark object system
    (ultima underworld 2)
    -> he's the guy who said "compile time hierarchy"
  - mach had a bug, where you could throw a lantern (fuel), and it would make
    damages (hp), so he had to check if hp exists for entity E.
    But the guy at lookingglass (mit graduates) didn't want to do that, but they
    don't know what else to do.
  - the did ultima underworld 1 & 2, then system shock
    they go to an outlinking kind of structure (2:07:30)
    entity with "shared" field + one link/pointer to extend it
  - flight unlimited
    first thing to use C++, they were using new/delete -> trashed out & fragmented memory
    (flight simulator)
    they had no fuel, but sometimes you would get an "out of fuel" message, because
    the memory was too fragmented
  - Tom Leonard, thief the dark project, came up with the entity component model switch
    instead of "entity.getHP", we're going to say "hp.getEntity"
    - they're thinking about
      "avoid fragmentation", "arbitrary-sized properties", "types at run time",
      "how fast is the fastest case?"

2h12m14s back to Q&A
- the domain model might not make sense for the computational version.
  doesn't need to have a model of thing, but we can have smth that gives the
  end user the effect of that thing.
  => 🔥The model inside the computer may have very little to do with the model
  experienced by the user🔥
  (which is in direct conflict with what Alan Kay wanted to do)
- failure to engage with the hardest problems,
  when you design new things, you should focus on the hardest stuff,
  it's harder to solve only simple stuff and scale it up to solving hard pb
- teaching architecture, would be better to focus on more flexible thinking,
  thinking about drawing the encapsulation boundaries with intent
